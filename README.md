# Postman Clone

Postman clone is an example of the famous HTTP client [Postman](https://www.postman.com) made with HTML and JavaScript. 

It has minimal styling with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) but its key feature is the ability to make API requests and display the result in a JSON format. 

[Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) is used to make the requests and [@codemirror/view](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@codemirror/view) text editor is used to display the result.
